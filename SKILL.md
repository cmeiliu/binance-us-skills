# Binance.US Briefing Engine

Generate account-aware Binance.US briefings. This skill is only valuable when it ties the market back to the user's own account.

This repository is a Binance.US skill family:

- root `SKILL.md`: flagship market-brief skill
- nested `SKILL.md` files: installable companion skills for research, funding, trading, and account status

If you want to discover the full family from the repo, use:

```bash
npx skills add cmeiliu/binance-us-skills --list --full-depth
```

If you want to install a nested companion skill, use `--full-depth --skill <name>`.

## When Not To Use

- explicit funding workflows
- spot-trade execution reviews
- account-status troubleshooting
- deep single-asset diligence after the user already picked a coin

The bundled script should prefer:

- price-anchored output over percent-only output
- 24h plus 7-day framing over single-window commentary
- market context before portfolio-specific conclusions
- upcoming catalysts, not just backward-looking news
- ranked, de-duplicated news tied to held or watched assets
- a concrete next step over generic portfolio CTA text
- a conversational advisor tone over compliance-report wording
- explicit watchlist gaps and idle-cash framing when those would prompt action

## Use This Skill For

- "Give me a personalized market summary"
- "What matters for my Binance.US account today?"
- "Summarize my watchlist"
- "Give me a portfolio brief"
- "Do I have idle cash or concentration risk?"
- "What changed since my recent trades?"
- "Give me a capital readiness check"
- "Give me a weekly reset"

## Core Rule

Prefer account-aware output over generic market commentary.

When credentials are available, use:

- current balances
- recent trading history
- watchlist or configured priority assets
- deposit history when useful
- recent headlines for owned, watched, or recently traded assets

If credentials are unavailable, the script can still produce a limited market-only brief, but it should say so clearly.

## How To Run

Run the bundled script:

```bash
python3 scripts/binance_us_brief.py --mode daily_brief --format both
```

Common variants:

```bash
python3 scripts/binance_us_brief.py --mode portfolio_brief --format text
python3 scripts/binance_us_brief.py --mode watchlist_brief --watchlist BTC,ETH,SOL
python3 scripts/binance_us_brief.py --mode opportunity_alert --alert-threshold-pct 5
python3 scripts/binance_us_brief.py --mode capital_readiness --format text
python3 scripts/binance_us_brief.py --mode asset_research --asset BTC --format text
python3 scripts/binance_us_brief.py init-config
```

## Install Behavior

- For local development, prefer the default install behavior without `--copy` so OpenClaw uses a symlink and picks up local repo changes immediately.
- For GitHub or copied installs, use `npx skills update` to pull the latest published version.
- The rendered brief includes a version/update nudge for copied installs so stale snapshots are easier to spot.

## Credentials

The script will look for Binance.US credentials in this order:

1. Environment variables:
   - `BINANCE_US_API_KEY`
   - `BINANCE_US_SECRET_KEY`
2. `~/.openclaw/secrets.env`
3. `~/.env`
4. `.env` in the current workspace

The script reads only specific keys and does not print raw secrets.

## Optional Config

The script supports a small JSON config at:

`~/.openclaw/binance-us-briefing-engine.json`

Create it with:

```bash
python3 scripts/binance_us_brief.py init-config
```

Useful fields:

- `watchlist`
- `quote_assets`
- `quiet_hours`
- `recent_days`
- `portfolio_currency`
- `alert_threshold_pct`

## Recommended Workflow

1. Run `daily_brief` for a broad summary tied to balances and recent trades.
2. Run `portfolio_brief` when the user wants account impact, concentration, or idle cash context.
3. Run `watchlist_brief` when the user asks about tracked assets.
4. Use recent news headlines to explain why those assets matter today.
5. Run `capital_readiness` to connect market setup to account readiness without sounding like a product push.
6. Run `opportunity_alert` for trigger-style checks on owned, watched, or recently traded assets.
7. Run `weekly_reset` for a slower, portfolio-aware recap.
8. Run `asset_research` when a brief surfaces a setup that needs deeper, structured follow-up.
9. Hand off to `binance-us-fund-account`, `binance-us-spot-trade`, or `binance-us-account-status` when the user is past the briefing stage and needs an operational workflow.

## Output Contract

The script returns:

- JSON only
- text only
- or both

The JSON output is the source of truth. The text output is the delivery-ready rendering.

## Guardrails

- Treat the brief as informational, not financial advice.
- Never claim certainty or guaranteed returns.
- Do not place trades automatically.
- If the user requests an action after reading the brief, handle that as a separate explicit step.
- This skill is read-only. It does not place orders, move funds, or change account settings.
- Allowed outbound domains are limited to:
  - `api.binance.us`
  - `news.google.com`
